## Introduction to stock markets, understanding stock market terminologies.

<br/>

### A. Understanding basics and terminologies

<br/>

1. LT = long term = minimum 1 year holding.

2. IDEAL LT definition for wealth creation means hold a stock for 5-10 years

3. If you are IDEAL LT, do not check portfolio every day, do not get panic if you lose -x% on a stock.

4. Read and understand what is CAGR? 

5. Always check profits or losses in % only.

6. Compare your portfolio returns against benchmark indices.
   (Benchmark indices for India are NIFTY50 and SENSEX)


7. Ideal returns for your portfolio should be at least 1.25 * benchmark indices.

8. Example if SENSEX and NIFTY rises by 10% in a year then your portfolio should outperform

    benchmark indices and your returns should be 10* 1.25 = 12.5%. Why? Because if your portfolio cannot beat benchmark index performance, then you should invest in index than stocks. (Such outperform comparison applicable for a period of 5 years.)


9. Read / follow ace investors like Warren Buffer, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, Vallabh Bhansali, Madhu Kela, Ramdeo Agarwal, etc. Try to check CAGR for ace investors like Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, Warren Buffet and then decide your CARG returns target.

10. Do not mix your LT portfolio with short term (ST) trades.

11. If someone want to invest in stock market for a horizon of less than 1 year, then its ST (short term) trade or investment. 

12. Avoid greed, invest money in stock market which you think, you wonâ€™t need for at least 5 years.

13. Do not follow tips blindly, do your own reading on a sector or a company before investing.

14. Follow govt. policies, RBI policies, geopolitical situations.

15. Assume, if you bought a stock and it makes fantastic returns of more than 30% within few months, then do plan to book partial profits. Timely profit booking also a good idea.

16. Start reading and understanding fundamental analysis.
